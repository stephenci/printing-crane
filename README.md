A crane style 3D printer

This printer is mostly developed for those who does not have access to CNC machine to make custom plate, carriage or holder from aluminum. 

The bulk of the structural material comprised mostly from openbuilds.com 

The controller I'm using is Replicape from thing-printer.com

The printer will be design using Fusion 360
